This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Table of Contents

This project is the first version of a Twitter site. It is still in process of development and I pretend continue this project for the class of Sistemas y Tecnologías Web 2021. What you can find here: React, React Redux and of course some Redux for the efficient use of forms you can create and use in the site. This file correspond to the frontend of the Twitter site. In this file you will find everything realted to the React and in the other file called "Proyecto-Web-master" is the backend of the project that uses pythong and the API. For this project I am using Django and a database for the usernames,etc. I know my professor did not asked me to do a crazy project like this one but I wanted to practice what I have been learning in Bases de Datos and Ingenieria de Software. I think this is a great project that I can continue developing until I finish the class.

There is just 1 HTML file in this whole project but it is just the one that is for default. It is when you create the react and it works as a template. I hope you still give me some points for it because it is not really something that I wanted to include hahah It just comes with it.

Besides the technologies that I used I think is worth it too say that in this project I used: React and Webpack

## Installation

You need to have Python, Yarn, Django and Node (12.18.3)
There is another file that specify the requirements for this project.

## Frontend and backend instructions

## `yarn install` 
Frontend: src: To download every single library that is required for the project.

## pip install -r .\requirements.txt
Backend: src: twitter_project: It is going to intall all python dependencies to run this project and at the same time to make it work with the API and DataBase.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
